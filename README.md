# Custom Voicebot for Ecommerce Customer Service

This project is a custom voicebot designed to assist customers with ecommerce-related queries. It uses speech recognition to understand user input, a LangChain conversational agent powered by OpenAI to generate responses, and text-to-speech to communicate back to the user.

## Features

- Speech recognition using Google's speech-to-text API
- Conversational AI agent for ecommerce customer service
- Text-to-speech output for natural interaction
- Handles product inquiries, order status, returns, shipping, and general support

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
5. Run the voicebot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Speak your ecommerce-related questions or requests clearly. To exit, say "quit", "exit", or "bye".

## Notes

- Ensure your microphone is set up and working.
- Internet connection is required for speech recognition and OpenAI API.
